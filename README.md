For Acer C710 Chromebook

I've found fixes for my Acer C710 in trying to get it to be a working machine. I'd rather have all the solutions I found in one place and I haven't really found anyone doing that. Please let me know if you know anybody else that is. Otherwise, I hope this comes in handy for anyone else considering turning a Chromebook into a full Linux laptop. I like the thought of accessing this in case something happens to my laptop.

Since this has been an afterthought, I don't have all the links and info immediatley available for current solutions. I will try to do that in the future. 

P.S. - I'm a newbie when it comes to using GitHub.
